## 🧩 **Usage**

Once you’ve installed the navbar component, you can easily integrate it into your React app.

### Step 1: Import the Navbar Component

In the file where you want to use the navbar (e.g., `App.js`), import the **OverlayNavbar** component:

```javascript
import OverlayNavbar from 'top-overlay-navbar';
```

### Step 2: Add the Navbar to Your App

Now you can place the **OverlayNavbar** component anywhere in your JSX:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <OverlayNavbar
        brandName="My Brand"
        menuItems={[
          { name: "Home", to: "/" },
          { name: "About", to: "/about" },
          { name: "Services", to: "/services" },
          { name: "Contact", to: "/contact" },
        ]}
        cartCount={3} // Dynamic cart count
      />
      {/* Other Components */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This will render the navbar with the specified brand name, menu items, and cart count.

## 🛠 **Customization**

You can easily customize the navbar to fit your needs by modifying the following:

- **`brandName`**: Set the name of your brand/logo displayed in the navbar.
- **`menuItems`**: Pass an array of objects to configure the links in your navbar. Each object should contain the `name` (text of the menu item) and `to` (the path for navigation).
- **`cartCount`**: Set the number of items in the cart. The navbar will dynamically display the count in a badge.

### Example:

```javascript
<OverlayNavbar
  brandName="Custom Brand"
  menuItems={[
    { name: "Home", to: "/" },
    { name: "Shop", to: "/shop" },
    { name: "Blog", to: "/blog" },
    { name: "Contact Us", to: "/contact" },
  ]}
  cartCount={10} // Cart count dynamically updated
/>
```
